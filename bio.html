        <h2>The Basics On Where I've Been...And Where I'm Going</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Hello. I am assuming that some of you visiting this website may not know very much about me, if at all. So, let me tell you a little about myself. </p>  
        <br>
        <figure>

        <p>I am from a small-town in Vermont - yes, that is a state! I am amazed by the amount of people that do not know that. While I truely enjoyed growing up in the country, where the air smells of pine trees and the roads are far-less traveled, I could not wait to get out and experience the world.</p>
        <br>
        <p>After graduating from high school, I spent a year at<a href="http://www.keene.edu/" target="_blank">Keene State College</a>in Keene, New Hampshire. I found my self in another lame ol' little country town. There's only two cool things about Keene: It is where Jumanji was filmed, and it is the host of the annual pumpkinfest, which may not sound like a very big deal to all my city-friends, but for all us back-woodsers it was a big deal. I had spent the majority of my life thinking that I wanted to work with children - either as a Teacher or a Family Divorce Attorney. There are two things I was always passionate about - children, and my parents divorce (I wanted to be able to help other children get through this unfortunate tragedy). I worked at a preschool center for awhile and ultimately decided that while I do love children, maybe this was not the career path for me.</p>
        <br>
        <p>So from there I took some time to really reflect on what I am good at, what I would truly enjoy doing for the rest of my life. I was only certain about one thing – I love projects. Projects of any kind. I enjoy the research, the planning, the implementing – I thrive off the rush I get in preparing to present something I have worked so hard on. So, Public Relations seemed like a good fit for me! Considering the prestigious public relations program at the<a href="http://www.ufl.edu/" target="_blank">University of Florida,</a>I ventured away from my country roots and headed for the sunshine state!</p>
        <br>
     <p>However, writing has never been my strong point, which poses a challenge for me in pursuing a career in public relations. It is something that I continue to work on every day, by reading more, blogging and even by producing this website. As I continue on my journey toward a career in PR I can only hope to continue to grow and learn.</p>
