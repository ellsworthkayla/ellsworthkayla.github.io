    <h2>Where I came from and where I'm headed</h2>
        <br>
    <p>Hello. I am assuming that if you are visiting this website you are likely a friend, family member, professor or potential employer. So, let me tell you a little about myself. </p>  
        <br>
    <p>I am from a small-town in Vermont - yes, that is a state! While I truely enjoyed growing up in the country, where the air smells of pine trees and the roads are far-less traveled, I could not wait to get out and experience the world.</p>
        <br>
    <p>After graduating from high school, I spent a year at Keene State College in Keene, New Hampshire. I had spent the majority of my life thinking that I wanted to work with children - either as a Teacher or a Family Divorce Attorney. I worked at a preschool center for awhile and ultimately decided that while I do love children, maybe this was not the career path for me.</p>
        <br>
     <p>So from there I took some time to really reflect on what I am good at, what I would truly enjoy doing for the rest of my life. I was only certain about one thing – I love projects. Projects of any kind. I enjoy the research, the planning, the implementing – I thrive off the rush I get in preparing to present something I have worked hard on. So, Public Relations seemed like a good fit for me! So, considering the prestigious public relations program at the University of Florida,I ventured out of my small-town lifestyle and headed for the sunshine state!</p>
        <br>
     <p>However, writing has never been my strong point, which poses a challenge for me in pursuing a career in public relations. As I continue on my journey toward a career in PR I can only hope to continue to grow and learn.</p>
